Description:
The Single Cycle MIPS Processor project is an implementation of a simplified MIPS  without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor using a single-cycle architecture in Verilog HDL.
This project provides a complete Verilog module that can execute instructions from the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA).

Key Features:
1. Single-Cycle Architecture: The processor follows a single-cycle architecture, where each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle, providing a simple and straightforward design.
2. MIPS Instruction Set Support: The processor supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set, allowing the execution of commonly used instructions such as arithmetic, logical, memory, and control flow operations.
3. Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Write Back: The module includes the necessary components to perform the four stages of instruction execution: instruction fetch, decode, execute, and write back.
4. Register File and ALU: The processor incorporates a register file for storing and accessing data, as well as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for performing arithmetic and logical operations.
5. Memory Unit: The module includes a memory unit that supports load and store operations, allowing data to be read from and written to memory.
6. Control Unit: The control unit coordinates the execution of instructions by generating the necessary control signals and managing the flow of data between different components.
7. Testbench and Verification: The project includes a testbench that provides stimuli and verifies the functionality of the single-cycle MIPS processor, enabling thorough testing and validation.
8. Simulation and Synthesis Ready: The module is designed for ease of simulation and synthesis, ensuring compatibility with different design flows and tools.
9. Documentation: Detailed documentation is provided, describing the processor's architecture, instruction set, and usage guidelines, assisting developers in understanding and utilizing the single-cycle MIPS processor effectively.
10. Open-Source and Community-Driven: The project is open-source, encouraging developers to contribute, enhance, and customize the processor based on their specific requirements.
